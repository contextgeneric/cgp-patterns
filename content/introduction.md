# Introduction

This book covers the design patterns for _context-generic programming_ (CGP), a new programming paradigm for Rust.

At its core, context-generic programming allows us to write _modular_ code that are _generic_ over different _contexts_.
Thoughout the book, we will slowly uncover what that really means.

## Work In Progress

This book is currently a work in progress. A majority of the chapter is yet to be written.
Please come back later to check out a completed version of this book.

## Scope of This Book

This book is written in the style of a reference material for readers with all levels of expertise.
As a result, it may not be as easy to understand for beginners who need a little more introduction
to more basic programming techniques in Rust.

A separate book will be written in the future, to provide beginner-friendly tutorials for learning context-generic programming.

## Chapter Outlines

The first section of this book, _Core Concepts_, will introduce core concepts of CGP.
We will learn about what is a context, and what are consumer and provider traits.

In the next section, _Basic Patterns_, we will cover the basic design patterns that enable us to write
context-generic code.

Following that, _Design Patterns_ will introduce general design patterns that are built on top of the
foundation of context-generic programming.

The section _Domain-Specific Patterns_ will cover use-case-specific design patterns, such as error handling and logging.

Finally, the secion _Related Concepts_ will compare context-generic programming with related concepts,
such as the similarity and differences of context-generic programming as compared to object-oriented programming.
